# Micro-Storytelling & Micro-Fiction Event

Prepare to be mesmerized by the magic of miniature narratives! Write Club invites you to the Micro-Storytelling & Micro-Fiction Event, a celebration of concise and captivating storytelling. Get ready to share under the spotlight, where brevity meets creativity at West Gate Social.

## [See the Judging Rubric HERE!](https://writeclub.ca/Rubric.pdf)

**Venue**: West Gate Social

**Date**: Wednesday, February 8, 2024

**How It Works:**
You get to tell your story, but keep it short and sweet. We're focusing on micro-fiction and storytelling that's short but impactful. Here's the plan:

**Micro-fiction Contest:**
Starting at 4:05 pm, the evening will begin with micro-fiction stories. Participants will have a chance to captivate the audience with their well-crafted stories in 3 rounds, and be scored by our team of judges for a chance to earn an Indigo Gift Card! These narratives need to be fictionalized. 

**Storytelling Contest:**
At 4:50 pm, after the micro-fiction contest, we'll move into a segment featuring competitive storytellers. In this part, participants will have a chance to captivate the audience with their well-crafted stories in 3 rounds, and be scored by our team of judges for a chance to earn an Indigo Gift Card! These narratives need to be true, personal, and ideally without notes. 

## Rules
* **Be Original**: All stories must be your own work.
* **Watch the Clock**: Micro-fiction shouldn't be more than 5 minutes. Storytelling pieces max out at 5 minutes.
* **Just Your Voice**: No props, or music. Let your words do the work. 
* **Point System**: Judges will be focusing on the quality of the performance and craftmanship of the piece. Each piece will be rated within 10-points by each judge. Three points are given based on the applause and cheer the audience makes. The audience can yell "HIGHER" to request the judges to add a point.
* **Sign Up Early:** Make sure to register beforehand. If you're late, you might not get to participate.
* **FREE DRINK TICKET:** Performers will get a free drink ticket!

# Poetry and Prose Slam

Are you ready to witness the power of words in a performance? Get ready, Writers! Write Club is bringing you a Poetry and Prose Slam! The spotlight will shine on YOU and your writing.

**Venue**: West Gate Social

**Date**: Thursday, December 7, 2023

**How It Works:**
Participants will have the opportunity to perform their original poems or prose pieces.
It's not just about the words; it's about the performance! Get ready to captivate the audience with your delivery. Here's how the event will unfold:

**Open Mic Session:**
We're kicking off the evening with an open mic session that invites all participants to take the stage and share their poetry or prose. This is a casual and inclusive segment, perfect for those who want to test the waters, gain some experience, or simply share their work without the competitive aspect. There's no judging in this phase; it's all about self-expression and community.

**Competitive Rounds:**
Following the open mic session, we move into the competitive phase of the Poetry and Prose Slam. In these three competitive rounds, participants will have the chance to perform their original poems and prose pieces with the aim of impressing our judges and the audience. Your performance, both in terms of the content and delivery, will be evaluated. A minimum of three pieces will be required. Separate prizes for poetry and prose will be awarded!
