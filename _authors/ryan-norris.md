Ryan Richard Norris was born and raised in Calgary Alberta, living there all his life except for a year abroad with his family in the Dominican Republic and a year long trip as a missionary in Florida. He is married to a beautiful young woman named Renae, and the two have been married for almost a year and a half. Ryan reads fantasy, but won't say no to anything he finds that is compelling, interesting or fun. He has played sports all his life, starting with hockey, a brief stint as a lacrosse goalie that ended before he wanted it to, and now has played rugby for the last five years. This is his first real attempt at writing a novel, having written many short stories and poems before this. His inspirations lie in authors such as Brandon Sanderson, Terry Goodkind, Christopher Paolini, Agatha Christie, and many more.
