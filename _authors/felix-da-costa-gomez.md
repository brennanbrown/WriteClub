Felix is a Canadian writer originally from Venezuela who is currently in their final year of an English degree and is the Vice President of Publications at Write Club. Their dream is to become an author, which they plan to pursue more vigorously once they have completed their academic studies. Felix's focus is on fiction pieces, with their latest work in progress being a Western trilogy set in both the American Northwest and Southwestern Canada spanning from the 1880s to the late 1910s. In addition to writing fiction, Felix has also recently discovered a newfound respect for poetry as an art form to express emotions, drawing on personal life experiences such as anarchy, reminiscence, and adolescent shenanigans.
