Robbi Fender, is a 32-year-old cisgender Métis woman who is employed as a Workforce Advisor while completing a Non-Profit Management certificate with Mount Royal University. Robbi’s passion for writing has been her creative outlet for many years while she sought to organize and understand her mental illnesses. Robbi was instructed at a young age to produce poetry that was lighter and broadened towards more relatable circumstances. She has grown to understand that her poetic insights around mental illness could be relatable to the right reader but has also worked on expanding her subject matter. Robbi is a lifelong learner and hopes to continue writing while in pursuit of her future endeavours.
