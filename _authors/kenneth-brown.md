Hi, I'm Kenneth, I'm a queer Métis writer and open-source web developer. I'm looking to do good—and I mean real good. I want to empower marginalized voices, emphasize stories that matter, and create long-lasting community. I'm looking to help those in the Alberta area with their next project with the unique skill-set I have!

I love researching and writing a wide variety of genre, from poetry to creative non-fiction I'm knowledgeable in multiple front-end frameworks and ecosystems, as well as an advocate for accessibility and the [A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) in web development.

If you think I can help you with a new opportunity, or you just wanna chat over a cup of decaf coffee. don't be afraid to shoot me an e-mail at: <mail@brennanbrown.ca>
