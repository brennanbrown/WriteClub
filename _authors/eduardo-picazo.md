Eduardo Picazo is a 23 year old student currently studying English at Mount Royal University. He was born in Mexico and moved to Canada young. An aspiring writer of fiction even as a young boy, Eddy has been creating stories in his head before he decided to write them down. His inspirations come from the things he loves: stories and mediums of stories. Video games, movies, books and tabletop RPGs are all things Eduardo happily enjoys. When he is not studying the things he likes and procrastinating any sort of work (including writing), he can be found petting his dog, Casper.
