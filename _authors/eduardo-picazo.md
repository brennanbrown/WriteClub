Eduardo Picazo is a very handsome 23 year old student currently studying English at Mount Royal University. An amateur and aspiring writer, he hopes to further develop and publish his current work-in-progress “Apotheosis: Death of the Maven” and an unnamed story about a robot lawn gnome. His inspirations come from the things he loves: stories and mediums of stories. Video games, movies, books and tabletop RPGs are all things Eduardo happily does. When he is not studying the things he likes and procrastinating any sort of work (including writing), he is partaking in said things he likes. The writer of this blurb would like to iterate how handsome and talented this fellow is, with no bias whatsoever.
