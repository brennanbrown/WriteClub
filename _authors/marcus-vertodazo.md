Mark (Marcus) Vertodazo is a Filipino-Canadian born in Calgary and raised within the South East neighborhoods of Forest Lawn. He is a full time student at Mount Royal University, majoring in Sociology while pursuing a minor in Creative Writing. Creatively, he identifies first as a Spoken Word Poet. He is also currently the VP of Outreach and Relations for MRUâ€™s Write Club. In his free time, Marcus spends his days getting lost in random neighborhoods on his skateboard, loitering in libraries and bookstores, and binge
listening to an artist's entire discography. His overall dream is to become an officially recognized poet laureate.
