<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Club

Mount Royal University's Creative Writing Club is a safer space for writers of all kinds and experience, both for a place to work and a place to (optionally) share, as well as offering prompts, activities, exercises, and sharing resources. Please read our [Code of Conduct](/terms).

In terms of what we're looking for and creating, any of the following apply:

- Prose
- Poetry
- Creative Non-fiction
- Travel Writing
- Experimental Forms
- Collaborative Works
- Fan-derivated Fiction
- and more!

Meeting times and location are still tentative. In the future, we hope to have events (such as open mic nights), writing retreats, guest speakers, and a physical publication.

If you're interested, either contact Kenneth (403.401.2718 / bbrow477@mtroyal.ca) or fill out this [**Google Form**](https://forms.gle/zxtW6GbomK14iWVD6). I'm looking for executives such as Secretary, Treasurer, VP of Social Media, and more.

And if you'd like to learn a little more about the founder, Kenneth, you can view some of [his work here](https://bkpoetry.com) and [here](https://wandernotebook.com), he also has [a book available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/DOGWOOD-VERSES-Chapbook-Selected-2011-2021/dp/B09KN7Y9K1/).
