Your basement is nothing like how you left it\
the smell of bud and nervous teenage sweat\
has been replaced by a stale fragrance like\
opening an ancient bag of chips\
and nothing like the girl I knew that\
always smelled of exotic vape cartridges\
and herbal resonance.

If you're wondering why I'm here, your dad let me in\
you know, the same dad that was asleep on the couch\
while we sang you happy birthday\
the same dad that kicked you out of the house\
after your mother was found dead in the basement\
I've known you for awhile, eighth grade art class to be precise\
which makes you different from other girls I've fallen\
in love with because I actually knew you before I loved you\
and not a mere five seconds after staring at your face\
You've grown different from the awkward\
thirteen year old girl that was always giggling\
about something at the back of the class\
but there are things about people that never change\
you still have that stupid, dumbfounded expression\
on your face and you're oblivious to the fact that\
you are an absolute atrocity to talk to\
because it is like speaking to a brick wall\
or like nailing somebody to a cross and have\
them not give you the satisfaction of a yelp\
Your fluoride stare is better than mine,\
or it would be if you were also staring into\
space thinking about brutally murdering the Prime Minister\
but you aren't, there's absolutely nothing going on\
inside of your head and that is why you had\
to retake Math 10C three times

We spent our eleventh grade third period spare\
baking ourselves in the Grandin alley while\
our friends were baking pies in culinary\
I watched as the smoke left your lips\
but lingered in your eyes and turned them\
into something resembling overgrown moss\
your eyes are so green\
not like the green people say is green but is\
actually just teal blue, but green like\
all the natural things in the world\
grass, weed, and vomit on your skirt\
from that one time I got drunk and\
decided I wanted to kiss you\
Hey, remember that time when we\
were wheezing in the cafeteria and\
your TA came in to talk about your\
skipping and she took one good look at us\
and knew we were higher\
than the dudes in the movies\
the enthusiastic smile on our faces,\
the teary red eyes\
and she leaned in, took a whiff and\
said "your friend needs cologne"\
and she walked away and we continued dying\
I remember that time when it was your\
birthday and Kienan and Sarah went\
upstairs to have sex and we sat there\
on the couch five feet apart\
and I said "they're having sex in your bedroom\
on YOUR birthday, how are you okay with\
this"\
and you craned your head slowly\
towards me and said "you're only jealous\
that he's up there having sex and you aren't"\
and I grew dangerously self aware of the

change of tension in the room\
as I could hear Kienan from up above,\
thrusting away at a girl he was probably going\
to hate in a week\
you looked at me expectantly\
and my broke ass didn't get you\
a gift so I kind of had a hunch\
you wanted something else\
and I unclenched and clenched my hands\
as you ushered closer and in a panicked climax\
I pointed past you and said\
"Hey, mind passing the bong?"\
That was the day I found out I was literally\
the biggest dumbass in all of Calgary\
I'm sitting on the couch right now\
but it doesn't feel the same\
the weight is unbalanced because\
you aren't on the other side and\
the table is purged from empty\
Heinakken bottles and loose cigarette\
butts we got at the Canyon Meadows train station\
the wall still has that puncture wound several\
feet from where the dartboard is from\
that time you hurled a dart at me and\
were yelling and crying about how\
I'm supposedly cruel to myself and as a\
consequence I'm cruel to others, you said\
"You're cruel because you don't think\
you deserve what you want"\
and it shocked me because I never\
thought such a profound assessment of\
character would come from somebody\
who had to take Religion 35 three times\
before they actually got the okay\
to graduate

The conversation is as subtle\
to me as your disappearance\
it happened years ago but I can still\
hear your voice stagnating off\
the walls like a bomb that was finally\
allowed to explode\
I'm laying on the floor with my arms wide open\
on the exact same spot your mother was found\
black and blue with her tongue hanging out of\
her mouth and I'm thinking about what\
you said to me and how right you were\
They say you're in Ontario now\
studying law and perhaps I did wrong you because\
I never expected you to be the one waving the hammer\
I'm thinking about how you're probably\
kissing boys that don't shy away from you\
and scurry to the other side of the room\
I'm thinking about how you're kissing boys\
that don't need liquid courage to touch you\
I'm thinking about how you moved more than\
1000 miles away and didn't even say a single word\
I've checked my phone every day, every hour, every minute\
I literally cyberstalked you and there was nothing to find\
the distance is like a cord around my heart\
and you're subconsciously pulling at the strings\
and even though they've already snapped its like\
you've created your own gravitational pull\
I guess I'm the world and I revolve around you\
But you know what, you're right\
You deserve someone that will kiss you and mean it,\
not just when they're drunk but stone cold sober

You deserve someone that will support your\
silence without being on Jupiter\
You deserve someone that doesn't assume you're\
slow because you're quiet\
You deserve someone that won't throw up on you\
when they lean in to give you what you've\
been asking for the entirety of high school\
You deserve someone that probably doesn't\
make metaphors about your dead mother to\
emphasise a point\
I'll leave this letter here so that you\
may find it years from now after your deadbeat\
father has hopefully passed and\
you'll be a new woman when you walk\
up these steps with a big strong man accompanying\
you and not some spindly English nerd\
and you'll have something that resembles a mini\
you trailing behind your legs\
I'll leave this letter here so that you\
may reminisce about a time when you\
were sixteen and deserved so much more

I'm laying on the spot on the floor where your\
mother died and I'm sticking my tongue\
out in mock expression and the only one\
laughing is me\
I let the cement slip away from my fingers\
as I try to grasp it, hoping to merge with the\
floor and become one with this space, but\
I think it's about time I leave\
I walk out the patio door and pass the smoke hut

and I give a sombre smile\
I loved you, and I wish I could've said it\
in present tense\
Your mother isn't the only thing that died in here.
