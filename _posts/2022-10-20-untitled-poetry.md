A thousand pictures away,
Drive together up hot rust
About we play luscious TV
You trudging on garden bed
Lust please rip him into meat.

My feelings: A person who is destroying photos while reminiscing an unsatisfying relationship

Scream shipping
Shadowed diamonds
By wind lick all away
Mist to me
Ugly but see
Never those with her and he

She and a sibling escaping their ugly reality by ship as stowaways.
