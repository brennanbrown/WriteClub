Rattle, Bump, Thump  
My head clunks against layered glass  
Double panes reflect a stranger  
She looks a lot like the past  

Her hair, it falls like cavalry  
A curtain of bloody silk  
I think I may have been her once  
Her skin like buttermilk  

She sits here on the bus with me  
Across the dirty window  
I never thought Iâ€™d see her there  
Forever trapped in limbo.
