When I am gone, weep not for my soul  
My goal was never to live forever  
Instead, I make way for other days  
Days when I shall be at peace  

<div style="text-align: right">
When I am gone, my spirit shall live <br />
Donâ€™t mourn for my death, instead <br />
Wear green and gold, so bold <br />
So I know that you are happy <br />
</div>

When I am gone, never shed a tear  
You may fear the end, but I do not  
For, when I am gone  
I will have lived
