"'Swan song' is a metaphorical phrase for a final gesture, effort, or performance given before death. The phrase refers to an ancient belief that the Mute Swan is completely silent during its lifetime until the moment just before death, when it sings one beautiful song. The belief, now had become proverbial in Ancient Greece by the 3rd century BC, and was reiterated many times in later Western poetry and art."

You're holding me like a burdened weapon; therefore, I start to sense hopelessness in trying to continue this. Paralyzed and forgotten, only holding on to the feeling of being freezing cold. With the lashing, receiving, and God-giving proceeding remarks that left me, abandoned, without even being told.

_In a nightmare, I am falling from the ceiling into bed beside you._

There once was a time where you'd approach into these sun-stained wooden doors and hold my hand. The way that I plead I could overlook. (The way I held yours.) But now we're lacking and retreating from words and defeating, whatever purpose we had. Different escalades for the bleeding renegades, black and bruised from the lines he came.

_You're asleep, I'm screaming, shoving you to try to wake you up._

Poor lines drawn out by men like I, who bore into the surface with hopes of flowering into quaking air. Where crop grow into a silver-tongued stain, to never get gain, to latch to stigma without flare. But where are my manners? All the enchanting has been slaughtered; I guess we're on our own. Inside the mythology bears only a single apology that the rest needs to and clinging to and pleading to survive.

_And like before, you've got no interest in the life you live when you're awake._

We'll hold here, and crash here, and die here, and love here, and bear arms and fruits and make believe that they're both the same. There isn't a single match or confront that could have prayed to God for change. Its just time to hand in the hammers that have been laced with passing and earth. The tools that built us a sought-found paradise where I wish I could stay.

_Your dreams still follow storylines, like fictions you would make._

But the messenger's been shot dead, and I find myself in place, talking to where God should be. But here I stand all alone and there isn't even a throne of which, I can see in my sights. Be it you or I who would be the one that has to die, I'm thankful it doesn't have to be you.

_So, I lie down against your back, until we're both back in the hospital._

I once gave you a swan song, a place for you to belong, but you pushed, pushed my spirits away. I'll keep the locket warm and clean and keep pretending we're both soft and sweet. When in this certainty there's only the inhuman veracity, there's only a second night now. Between the days where I go blind and hungry and latch onto your spine. Where I once planted the seeds of wings and the rings to grow, and in the sweet wind chime on row.

_But now it's not a cancer ward, we're sleeping in the morgue._

We're so far past that it isn't even a thought now, in the trails of our discontent I seem to create for myself. I'm sorry for leaving, but in the meantime why don't you go out to the fields, and catch me a few lilacs? For I'll most likely need them for a deathbed I'm building underneath, where your footprints once met.

_Men and women in blue and white, they are singing all around you._

The place where your body walks and the place where your heart will talk on, and on and on. It's a wonderful bliss, I guess, if you don't mind the mist, the mist, of having no one, alone. When you realize you can speak all you want with no one hearing you, no one perceiving or conceiving.

_With heavy shovels holding earth, you're being buried to you neck._

But where's the battle lines? For I can't help but to see I'm playing a game, all my own. You aren't even there now; I'm absent in dreaming the way I was with you. But I guess I'll just take it for granted that I had at least met you. Had met you. And I'll be thrown into the cold dark place of despair by the figure, I don't even know.

_In that hospital bed, being buried quite alive now._

And as he tries to guide me, I'll realize too late, that there's no need to know. And I'll realize that inside myself comes the solution, to use, to use on me. Just to use me. Maybe finally one day I'll come out of the drains and hope to wake up and die. But these words are digressing birds in their dressing on top of forest fires and sweet humming electrical wires. And maybe that is where, one day I shall stand, to see you for a final time.

_I'm trying to dig you out but all you want is to be buried there together._

Deem me thespian and doomed to fail under quixotic nature, at least I know my bounds. Where due time has come in, to take me and drowned him, the ghost, I had to give up. It's a shame if I may say; I'll know in my heart, that there is worth where the romanticism is that I have endured.

_You're screaming._

The love that stems out from verbs, the love that kills all, if heard. The kind that marries you away, the kind, that'll solemn it's own say. But if the day were to come where the spark forces reality, I don't know where I would stand. Where I would stand. There are only two things that need to know, I'm sorry, and I've been in love with you since the day we have met.

_And cursing._

I'll stand here and watch my own aftermath, if you wouldn't mind so. I will take a leisure place upon a secret low. Where drowning into the sea between the summer's skin and spring's sweet snow, lay a beauty that will never be enough to let me know. Enough to stop the anger stop the emotional, stop the humanity overall, the things that'll cover us until us finally fall.

_And angry._

Falling into the hollow, I'll chuckle and deride, speculate why I am such a piteous being, climbing, searching, always leeching on to the concept that's sheer worth is now becoming extinct. Unless I'm wrong, though, there won't be need. We've left and sent the last smirk to the combustion and hoarfrost. Where dead to the world, maybe, the only thing I will truthfully eternally tell.

_And hurting me._

I am sightless of myself in face of this echo. For no longer can I tell what you undergo. The undermining of myself resembles the undermining of you, I wished this would change anything. (Are you apprehensive? Are we any of the same?) And I start to disbelieve that I ever did, so what should I care how significance it is?

_And then smiling._

We'll descend and eventually breathe our last. But bonded by the atmosphere is lest a simple act. I can't see any further now, why not start from the beginning for me, now? Where I wasn't the jester. Where I wasn't frolicked for trickeries, the wagers of my life were placed higher than my faults. My blunders. Perhaps it is mere folly. Request to preach to me, that I am ahead on a surreal landscape of foolishness and idiocy.

_And crying._

I formerly voiced towards myself that I could prophesize with pen, boasting my aura of achievements that weren't even there. Then you became certain I was talented enough. Talented enough to set aside a commission, so I wrote for you about letting go about the past. Every day my thoughts are resorted to memories. It's a brisk turn; nobody ever knows when the bleeding will stop. When the tantalizing becomes accepted after the scorn of numbness and desensitizing.

_Apologizing._

Demanding and trying, all I want to do is sleep now. Siesta the nocturnal and your figure away, it makes me regret the fact I'll keep coming back towards the same morning. And I'll be wide awake. It's the spelling of atrophy that has finished me so weakly, fallen for you, as the similar humming muses me inside the background's fa√ßade. Who knows how it goes, from this point on when the inferno is shown as present tense, menacing to eradicate?

_I've woken up, I'm in our bed, but there's no breathing body there beside me._

I sense the oncoming presence of their droning, whirring against me. Telling me I must stop my charades, which death isn't what I've made it out to be. But I'm not a proper madman. I have not yet womanized the idea of whatever shall come afterwards. Frolicking, instead, upon wilting lilacs, purple and young.

_Someone must have taken you while I was stuck asleep._

I wouldn't mind that there wasn't a climax. Was it only that while walking through and pushing through, I can only be reminded of you? Through my senses, because you cannot tell by such a different alias. The one you've built from heartbreaking and heartless and tyranny and cruelty you've been vision-less too. As the visionaries around and around weep at the sight of the broken before built or the reckless before worn.

_But I know better as my eyes adjust._

Moments are needed in frail times like these to catch a simple breath outside of the courteous dishes you've used and worn. Worn for the better, a simple and beautiful attire, suited for a Princess I once saw you as in fantasy. Maybe I wish as badly as you do for the ability to go there. To go back. There are always the simpler times, but perhaps you don't conceive the vices that have been caused by those ages, in allotment.  

_You've been gone for quite a while now, and I don't work there in the hospital._

If one thing moral may come out of a traumatized epiphany, the corrupted feelings I have perturbed towards an arrow shot at whoever was closest to the bow. Details no longer become important, girth becomes buried and subdued into a pitiful fall that reaches only miles beyond reach. Do you even realize how many people have died for such a grasp?

_(They had to let me go.)_

Falling and climbing, too much of both start to consume. As I am forced to revise my thoughts for the public's mind's eye. And build ladders that'll escalate thoughts into voice-patterns that will shake the night and pretend to hold meaning, use, value or care. The sixteen-living garbage-filled ideals will suffocate themselves in such a catastrophic display. Eventually, I'll realize this, and it won't hold any values to the decisions that come afterwards. (Whatever they may be.)

_When I try to move my arms sometimes, they weigh too much to lift._

The scattering is a leave of heartbreak and a gift from the implications is a broken vintage huddled warmth, raising the temperature with anger. I wish I could lie and say it surprises me still, but no longer can a burden'd beak that lays on a bird with plague be the one they force to drop and slumber inside empty eateries. We all grow old eventually, the time where we break and where we leave and take off or drivel in excuses is up to you, love.

_I think you buried me awake._

Plant the trees, if you wish. Pull out the lilacs and play the pedals tunes. Discords that hum and jump out of a hollow'd out lake created out of Mercury. I pour it all out to see the autumn leaves fall upon it. Experimented with falling stars and breaths of air until the yonder they used to talk about before the turmoil and fallout exasperate, and I begin to fall and stay silent.

_(my one and only parting gift.)_

Pretend the way we stand is a hold of a slow dance to the music being hummed far away and sought after by a mind and an afterthought. I'm sick of pretending with you. I'm sick of pretending without you. No matter has it become, to hold or stand or break. Nothing will change or talk to the life to come. The will to forfeit to the outside. Giving the graces and sermons that grow elder and the sun starts to set on the other side of this planet.

_But you return to me at night just when I think I may have fallen asleep._

I already can foresee you break the silence, but you won't speak unless spoken too. Still, very still. Wishing against the requests you've been given over time. The forgotten and neglected cherry tree that once laid and held kingdom to my gardens before we ever met, leaving inside the history. But such nature never existed before me. If you understand the cryptic, I assume. I still suspect the inner to chase and take hold eventually again. (It's no use is art.)

_Your face is up against mine, and I'm too terrified to speak._

I'm bruised and badly beaten inside and out, and I've given up any ghosts that have haunted me for the past six or nine or twelve months of my life. But I am not sorry, and simply remember the lines said to me every day I choked on my own pride: Love is going lead you by the hand. Into a white and soundless place. Now we see things. As in a mirror dimly. Then we shall see each other. Face to face.

_You're screaming._

You're bored of cheering me up. Bored of calming me down. Bored of drying my eyes. But there was once a time when you were the one. The blue of the sky. After the storms. The switch on the wall. In the dark of the hall that I'm still fumbling for. Because I'm still lost in the black. I don't know where I am. I have my arms stretched out in front. And I'm calling your name just as loud as I can.

_And cursing._

You had a swan song once, a place that would embody the dying breath of the only living creature who could love pure. A gentle place I built out of tenderness, for you to belong, to keep my spirits away. I'll always keep the locket warm and clean and keep pretending I'm soft and sweet. When in this certainty there's only the inhuman veracity, there's only a second night now. Between dead days latched onto your breath. Where I once planted the seeds of wings and the rings to grow, and in the sweet wind chime detached.

_And angry._

The deceased advised, one simple parable: Love stems out from verbs. The love that kills all if heard. The kind that I wish I could marry you away with. The kind that'll solemn its own say into its own grip. The day will never come, where to where the spark forces reality. I don't even know where I would stand. Where I would stand. Where I would fall. And breathe a definitive carefree breath, that there are only two things that need to know: I'm sorry, and I've been in love with you since the day we have met.

_And hurting me._

I start to collapse, and memories of love, my love, a blanket. A blanket, warm and soaking wet. While you're screaming and choking, "Out- out!" As you will hold me through, as a loaded armament; I start to sense my own existence is the cause for my damnation and I finally get the hint. Paralyzed and forgotten; the only feeling now is the one, holding on to the feeling of being freezing cold. With the lashing side comments you'll say without thinking, receiving and God-giving proceeding remarks that left me, abandoned, without even being told.

_And then smiling._

There's only one message, one siren left, preceding, all the rest have abandoned me. Abandoned with me. The slurs and plea's I once were able to say with haste, that I thought would somehow gain your attention or deem worthwhile. For only the seasons can prevent the aftermath that occurred before. From this point on, there is only the faint repeating, no longer a new melody from the skylarks, the nightingales. All the beautiful in the world slowly deceasing as I replay the thoughts in my head.

_And crying._

I wander and think to myself, as the harsh bitter cold takes me. As it confesses to me. All that I can confess. Moving slowly toward the Ember stars, thrusting and moving. Moving toward the images I wish to be... I wander close and far. You, however. My dear, sweet and sick sister of mine; With love unbounded by this race or blood, can wander no more. After the soundings of drops of rain. And after the quiet sounds when I scream your name. You wander no closer to me. So, I wander, closer to you.

_Apologizing._

The boy said to himself, smiling innocently at the night. He ran towards home. Staring at the sky, tears starting to fill his eyes, hoping there was a star listening, "I wish I could have said sorry."
