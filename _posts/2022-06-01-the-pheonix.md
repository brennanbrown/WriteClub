Shiver and shiver, near, for you cry. To lean above benevolent lullablies. Resume the almighty. Ebb'd and flown through windpipes - from an earlier dusk, that settled in
before we knew all that was. In allegory's sin.

Have you had come here before, to witness the sights. Of the all-mighty feathers. Boasting in harsh light. Where keen is the wandering man. Where wounded soldiers fall towards the sands.

Burning inferns, travelling across the head of the world, traveling all the way, to tails of a boon. Where ascending darkness shall take it's path. Once the skies and fields collapse. From agony of apathetic arms. Where

Quiver and screech above fields of skies. Let take rest those who mimick in stride. They hold themselves. (I hold you, too) They carry themselves, so honest without truth. Where they bask in lights that blind the rest. Where their heads lie in the caress, of a wounded bird, mocking and stalking it's hunters. Where it soars above, to never departure.

From epitome of last in line, to where they meet is so slow and fine. Beseech! Qualms of counting over millennia, where we find ourselves tangled from such mania. Strangled in lies and laughter and overtones near. A roar, and a thunder.

Closer and close the rumble shall become. Until midst morning dew shall succumb. To sweet gentle rehearsals of the universe falling. Due to a firefight Deity's find appalling. When we end in arms and arms will end. A battle call and cry, we all must defend. Where a justice Mary will take her part. In trying to climb above the dimensions of Man's start.

For the bird draws near.

The Earth shall shake, the lives and eyes shall slowly and outlie die. Where wings were spread there shall only be cries. To call out the love hiding beneath the cracks. To call out to the strength, being muster'd in collapse. Save yourself, for love is simply gone. Where wing-beast is foe and shall tremble near dawn.

Awaken from providence, lashing out at dawn's indifference. Awaken from might, where there is none left of abstinence, where all breathe freely as fools. This is but the nest for the wandering, cruel.

Shows himself outside casket's midday, where the thunder can be a child in play. Pushed and pulled, harnessed by beak, the foe it is strong. If her will was not so weak. So instead of letting such cries out. The seadevil drowns for due South.

And South shall it go.

Here, heed call. A movement collapsing. Drawing near, drawing near. It is but the lightning here. Drawing near, drawing near. Sweet mythical sacred firebird that can be founded in dunes. The weakness in me, in all, welcomes you.

Called out from all sides, all quivers, in delight. Henceforth:  
the Arabs,  
the Persians,
the Greeks,
the Romans,
the Egyptians,
and Chinese,  
the Indian and Phoenicians.

All bow and greet. All bow to you, in your raging warmth. To come into play at the midnight's first warn. With a colorful plumage, and a tail of gold and scarlet, purple, blue, and green. Go out into the starlite and be seen.

Go off and take what is yours from man. Take our timber, take our riches, take our Sun, build graves in sweet ditches. Let yourself go, aflame'd in suspire. Where to be known is all, in deep, such fiery fright.

Where you, sweet, can be returned to ash. Ash to ash and to embalm the ashes of your old self in an egg made of myrrh, depositing in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis. And the youngling shall arrive, curdled from the very stems of heat and far. Reborn, a new, to once again live. To live in spite in sake of the land, to where with the stars you lay hands. In search of the lasting, evading sweet scent. Of those who shall worship you, and down in dirt shall repent.

Where you settle, O, cry out to me. In the Aberdeen Bestiary. Cry out to me. With your beaut of a song. Settle in kindle where you belong. You will cry out, rebirth, immortality, and renewal.

Do not let me keep your company, let us both shallow along within Hohokam. Where your spirit shall be freed. Let us both move along, to the ending point, where the fires shall bleed.

Warm in warmth, caught high in delight. Skies a plenty, even at night. Where fairview is simple, and easier task, where the Phoenix shall reach. Flames made out of glass.

In both service and solitude. In both envy and love. In both haze and yesteryears. I will bow. Tomorrow, i will bow; the day after, i will bow. The complexities of physics muddle even the truest of arrows. The reaping halos beckon for a softer landing but they are returned with a silent response.

And it is yr duty, and yr duty alone to interpret this silence as "no". Sweet golden albatross. You sing a highlighted melody with quicker pace than my infantile heart.

Beating, beating, beating. Steppingstones i throw while impatiently waiting for Aristotle. For the likes of answers to my humming questions. Not the sung inquiries and curiosities, though. I instead wait for the murmurs to have a doorknock. Play with me in between yr fingers like idle figure-skating.

The clayed cremation of my abdomen speaks in a different tongue than which i have been used too. Used too the ridicule of routine overtaking the overpass and skipping over the important sand-drawn lines of adventures. But the faeries can only pity you for so long. And the fruit will invariably rot if you do not consume. And so without disdain--- nor knowledge--- i consume. I weep at the wedges of divinity stuck in between my teeth, the ghosts of holy warriors. I weep at the archangel that christen me the boy that shall carry hyacinths, least with eyes. I weep at the sultry piano keys that dawn inside my mouth before i try to sleep.

Arise, gentle myth. From the shoulders of the bruised pebbles. These humble pebbles of which you used to sit upon and gaze unto the honey-rabbit above, swimming with the stars as yr embers burned out for a final time.

Arise, gentle myth. From the shoulders of negated funerals, of the moats that rose above their duties and created a multitude of moats around yr palms & teeth.

Arise, gentle myth. From the shoulders of the wise old man who mirror'd you in ways that could never be fathomed in this universe. You walk, mildly. You glow, poised with a milky grin. I know you are awake. I know that i, too, am awake.

Arise, gentle myth. From the shoulders of poetry that would once leave you well-rested with mere sips of starry-fluid. That the gender of yr breath would cause heartache on heartache. Lest the vague overtones drowned you out.

Arise, gentle myth. From the shoulders of the unquenched philosopher. Society weeps louder, now. Society would screech were she not bound and gagged by the crucifix she built. Fire-truck wrists fortify firecracker dreams that last only seconds.

We are the embers, now. We have not the pleasure, but the forceful obligation to birth the single-kissed caterpillar tree-houses with innumerable marble columns. So rapidly engrossed in our affairs, we must lead the workers blindly. We must love the touch of their skin unconditionally as we do.

We are the embers, now. We are the newfounded kingdom destined to obliterate the salts of the earth of past & present. To run our forgotten nails across her crevasses. To run our forgiven hair across her teary-laid waterfalls. I beckon you.

We are the embers now. We have the mythological & civic duty to capacitate our infinitesimal lungs into a forever known lust of thought and tender politic. Gentle and curved at the touch.

As our feet will trip, as our minds will flirt with the whiplash of tomorrow, we cannot allow ourselves to fall from the backs of the phoenix hyacinth--- more majestic in beauty than in sorrow. The attached generation of child sculptures--- with enough magnitude and velocity to cause Michelangelo to fall to his knees.

We are slowly reaching critical mass. We are reaching our destination at speeds never possibly witnessed prior to this current breath. We must take ourselves--- hand in terrified hand--- to new heights

To not guide us to utopia, no. To instead guide us to a world, braver than this.
