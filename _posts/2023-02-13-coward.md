I’m stuck here, staring over the edge  
I am my freedom, that was my pledge  
Why can’t I just  
Jump

A lump forms in my throat again  
Am I still at the mercy of men?  
Or am I just a  
Coward

To pitch myself right off the cliff  
I’d hoped to finally close that rift  
Maybe I am still  
Unworthy

To give a pair of wings to my soul  
Was that really too lofty a goal?  
I guess I’ll never truly  
Fly
