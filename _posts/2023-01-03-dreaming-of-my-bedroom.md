There are at times, the good nights---  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there's felt the softness of lilacs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their color deciding to fill up the morning sky.  
There are blossomed animals, soft and dreary-eyed,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I witness them from the window of my room,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the glass felt more like a clear. heavy water.  

The pane carefully placed above my writing desk---  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as though it was the most important piece  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the architect painstakingly sketched.  
The desk itself a dark cherry wood, creaking  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it's burdensome figure presses against the floor.  
  
Only a quilted bedframe sits beside the lectern table,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the place where I can. at times, slumber peacefully.  
And when I manage, this scene plays itself back,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on repeat, as I feel the softness of lilacs once again.
