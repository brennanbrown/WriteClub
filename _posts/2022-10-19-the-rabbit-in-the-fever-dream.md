The weeping lady in the white dress, within the high pitch fever dream,
screams at the kettle with bare feet, while wandering the grasslands.
The blonde man, strolling on top of graves, where the caskets hide, greets her.
He hands her a golden plate of vegetables and offers to peel her skin.

He covers her skin with olive oil and begins to peel her.
The blonde man, skinning her breasts and toes with a vegetable peeler,
accuses her of her enjoyment; she declines, as she tilts her back, sitting on the headstone
Chestnut eyes dart at the open wound on her breasts, crimson drips, to peer over back at her.

She could hear the screeching from the kettle on top of the hot plate;
the aroma of burnt toast lingering from the kitchen and into the bedroom,
and the wailing timer of the oven going off.
All of it remains, except for the white cotton sheets under her.

She does not ponder about her health,
nor does she wonder if their future will have children.
Oddly, she is thankful he eats his vegetables with her
as he peels the soles of her feet.

Her sigh, worn, and exasperated,
swallowing the wind as the boughs creak,
her chestnut eyes reaching for the grass
it is nothing and everything to her.

She lies over white sheets, naturally attempting to heave
His pale face and whirlpool eyes becoming bokeh, as water clouds her vision
Viewing him and herself in comatose
Her lips only moving to catch the air

His thumbs pressed on the indent of her neck 
almost as if he was trying to mark her with his fingerprints.
His nails pushed inwards to the sides of her velvet flesh- burgundy and violet.
How did they end up here?

The man in the white rabbit suit runs down the road on a hill towards me through my wide lens.
My camera hits the floor as he lunges at me with his two huge rabbit feet.
He rips my clothes into tatters and gropes my breasts in circular motion.
His evil eyes scavenging my entirety as he sits on top of me on the lonely road.

My forehead pools in tears from the fever dream, a memory.
I hope to never see him or her again
