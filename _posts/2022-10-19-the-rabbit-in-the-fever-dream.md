The weeping lady in the ivory dress, within the high pitch fever dream, <br />
screams at the kettle with bare feet, while wandering the grasslands. <br />
The blonde man, strolling on top of graves, where the caskets hide, greets her. <br />
He hands her a golden plate of vegetables and offers to peel her skin. <br />

He covers her skin with olive oil and begins to peel her. <br />
The blonde man, skinning her breasts and toes with a vegetable peeler, <br />
accuses her of her enjoyment; she declines, as she tilts her back, sitting on the headstone <br />
Chestnut eyes dart at the open wound on her breasts, crimson drips, to peer over back at her. <br />

She could hear the screeching of the kettle on top of the hot plate; <br />
the lingering aroma of burnt toast from the kitchen, <br />
and the wailing timer of the oven going off. <br />
All of it remains, except for the white cotton sheets under her. <br />

She does not ponder about her health, <br />
nor does she wonder if their future will have children. <br />
Oddly, she is thankful he eats his vegetables with her <br />
as he gradually peels the soles of her feet. <br />

Peels of skin, like strips of film, form recollections of their memories, <br />
forbidding her from leaving the fever dream and the graveyard. <br />
Her sigh, worn, and exasperated, swallows the wind as the boughs creak, <br />
her dull chestnut eyes reach for the lush grass, it is nothing and everything to her. <br />

She lies over white sheets, naturally attempting to heave <br />
His pale face and whirlpool eyes become bokeh, as water clouds her vision. <br />
Eyes shut, omnipresent, she views him and herself in comatose. <br />
Yet, the saliva hardly able to slip down the thin pathways of her throat commands her to move.

Her chapped lips move only to catch the air; his thumbs pressed on the indent of her neck <br />
almost as if he was trying to mark her with his fingerprint. <br />
His nails pushed inwards to the sides of her velvet flesh—burgundy and violet. <br />
How did they end up here?

Her beige face almost became more ashen than his—more violet. <br />
The scleras of her eyes are bloody red, all else of her body dark, her mind and her heart. <br />
Pitch dark, dash into the night, into another dream, <br />
for what once was her broken dream about a quaint cabin with a lover's heart.

The man in the white rabbit suit runs down the road on a hill towards me. <br />
He collapses me onto the asphalt as he lunges at me with his two huge rabbit feet. <br />
In triumph, he rips my clothes into tatters and gropes my breasts in circular motion. <br />
The abyss in his ebony eyes scavenges my entirety as he sits on top of me on the lonely road.

My forehead pools in tears from the fever dream, a memory. <br />
I hope to never see him or her again
