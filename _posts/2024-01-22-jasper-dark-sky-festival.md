We were lost in the streamers of Aurora Borealis,  
the dark starry sky bearing blue butterflies—  
to arrive at a wooden bridge over tiny glaciers  
between lit wavering candles. An Aurora  
flagging your head, says we could maybe  
hold each other with your glove on my waist.  

A sign says, FOLLOW FOR DRONE LIGHT SPECTACLE.  
We herd with the crowd, you look for the drones,  
as they all look on Google Maps on their phones.  
Drones circle, drawing Saturn. The Jasper Dark  
Sky Festival is lit in the wildflowers of drones. An Aurora  
from Kindergarteners, rainbow paper mache.

An Aurora I scribe. A boy is tickled by a snowflake  
melting, a scene from Lost in Translation—are those  
happy or sad tears? Two drones butterfly-kiss.

A neon green raver aurora, drowns in fire smoke, awake  
late dancing, leaks poison on the faces of black bears and deer,  
they are sad because their cubs and fawns are emo and  
missing at the stripclub. Zootopia makes more fermented sugarcane.

A lonely athletic old woman, shakes as she instructs  
yoga at the festival, yelling into a microphone,  
between evergreen of snow, and shaking mothers with kids—  
no father—in Warrior 1 poses. Mothers lined-up, who are much  
past home time like the fathers and awake during the Aurora.

Aurora looks too poisonous, too much of a raver  
at twilight, stop looking, it looks stupid. Aurora magenta  
has brain fog from no sleep, wailing on the homework.  
An Aurora streamer says, clean up the garbage please.  
Another Aurora streamer says, nah, you do it.  
Museums of Auroras we wandered into  
since the dawn of youth angst. You drew a  
caricature of me at Stampede with Kahlo  
and Piglet with wings. The plane my mother took  
to Canada—sit between the Aurora for a picket fence.

Incel Aurora of purple waves at us, waiting  
for deer to pop-up like a virus. An animal night tour  
too populated, made for us. I want to go alone with  
you instead, watching grizzly bear families, stomp  
tracks in the snow, with you, but I know  
grizzly bears run and gallop faster than us.

Only the Aurora Borealis can make us feel guilt  
for our attention-span and need for novelty or  
modernism. Nothing comes close to the Aurora. Even,  
when I say, *you’re a stupid cheater*, it's bright.

*You’re right,* you reply, *maybe one day you’ll be*  
*okay with that, I’m sorry, but you have to accept*  
*that it happened. I guess we’re both waiting to be the*  
*Aurora*—the crowd will watch us, flickering  
lights on their faces, even at three AM, at our tired eyes—  
*Even when you’re a stupid cheater, you’re bright.*
