Perpetually fixed, perfectly placed in the  
ripeness of summer,  
forever teetering on the cusp on June and July;  
The body is heavy, flushed, rife - youthfully fertile and  
yielding younglings monthly  
tenderly sweet, thickly rich as  
they dangle from outstretched limbs;

The body is waiting, poised, ready - unknown & unwanted  
hands tear the  
exposed gems promptly,  
utlilizing sharp teeth to greedily  
skin and  
peel back  
their soft coverings;  
The body is barren, ruined, taken,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empty.
