Peaceful lazy flakes  
Silently land on my cheek  
Cold. Then, cold again  

Flowers stretching wide  
From their quiet slumbering  
A bee lands softly  

Days warmth into night  
Fireflies lighting the path  
Worries melt away  
 
Carried by the wind  
Leaves slowly dance to the ground  
To settle and rest
