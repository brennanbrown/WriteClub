Imperfections hide away.  
knowing that any appearance they make,  
could potentially ruin the surface I had to create.  
The words spoken,  
were so deliberately perfect  
to the insecurities that laid within.

my own acknowledgment of failure was hard enough to face,  
it was even harder hearing you agree.  
i always thought we'd get past this,  
it was just a rough patch.  
who was I kidding.  
when you were mad,  
isn't it obvious that I must be mad too?  
it was always a disappointment to hear that I could do something,  
that I could one day be happy.  
move on from this.  
in your mind you believe that I couldn’t possibly get over this,  
because you wouldn’t be able to.  
but I’m not you.  
you're only hurting yourself now,  
I will no longer be brought down by your guilt.  
you can’t expect me to listen and hear honesty from you,  
because it's an unlikely occurrence.

I was taught at a young age to walk carefully,  
don’t break the egg shells that lay at my feet.  
walk slowly,  
the ripples in the water could lead to disaster.  
don’t let your mother cry,  
because it is,  
and always will be,  
your fault.
