Please understand I am not what you want.  
‘What is a dream’ they ask of you. What is it that your heart desires?  
And you imagine me.  

I choke on my spit and bury myself six feet underground and  
Think of places I long to be but never make.  
I carry myself with bullets in my pocket and a mind hollow and heavy  
That I sink with every step.  

You think of me as the universe.  

Think of me not  
As someone who is worthy of money  
Or power  
Or love  
Or a life worth living  
As a life worth living is an idea only  
Gods can build

And I am mortal.

Empty your devotion  
Onto me and  
Watch how your lungs  
Collapse.

Please understand I am not what you want.  

Do not move with purpose  
If you are moving to me.
