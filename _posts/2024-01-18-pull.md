pull me away  
I can’t handle the world right now  
like I’m supposed to, like I used to  
I can’t pretend right now as well  
as I’m used to  

I’m breaking just a little bit  
and everything shows through  
I’m not really cool or chill  
just heartbreakingly strewn  
I’m reaching and falling  
it’s tormentingly cruel  

I’m making up words out of  
pretending to be okay  
this whole damn poem  
is a fucking cliché  
I've forgotten how to write it  
I’ve forgotten what to say  

there are too many specific memories  
flashing through my brain  
too chaotic to set anything straight  
can I lay my head on your shoulder  
pull me away
