They just keep coming.  
No matter how broken I feel,  
No matter my pleas,  
They just keep coming.

They stop me dead in my tracks,  
With whispers of worries out of my control.  
They hit me hard but leave no visible marks.  
They just keep coming.

They consume my mind.  
Unable to focus on what’s around me,  
Only harsh words are deeply ingrained by them.  
They just keep coming.

They tell me to feel shame.  
They tell me to feel guilt.  
They tell me I will forever be theirs to torment.  
They just keep coming.

I’m not normal,  
They tell me.  
I know,  
I whisper.

Visibly functioning,  
Capable to the eye.  
But they always tell me otherwise.  
They just keep coming.

Paralyzed by the beliefs of their constant words.  
Forever consumed,  
Forever their prisoner.  
Forever to be captured by my own mind,  
My own thoughts…

They just keep coming.
