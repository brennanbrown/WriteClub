I went to college like a bird swimming\
like a woman burning in the 1700s\
or like an atheist rising\
I cut my nails like a narcissist killing himself\
as if I'm a vampire taking a stake to the heart

or more like a vegetarian hunched over sucking blood\
What Trudeau calls economics I call toilet paper,\
because it's worth less than the rough, skin peeling,\
school material I use to wipe my ass\
everytime I walk past EA I think about taking\
the vaccine van and driving it through the window as\
students leap from their chairs in a desperate\
attempt to not waste the thousands of dollars\
they've spent on what they think is their soul\
and I'm sitting there wide eyed, the glass\
coming down like the plague that purged the Isrealites\
when in reality I'm just a pawn that refuses to move\
to the next tile\
I get off at Heritage station everyday and I see\
more ass on middle aged white dudes than\
I've ever seen on a woman but this kind of ass\
is unsightly and defiled and if you keep\
following with your eyes the arms who\
own it are just picking and shaking,\
digging for another vein to finally\
find some relief\
I talk about moving to the middle of\
buttfuck nowhere and growing potatoes\
and carrots like some poor famished redheaded freakazoid\
but for now I'm too addicted to the counterfeit image\
flashing over my eyes so I'll take myself\
up on the offer when good games stop coming out\
You know, I spend way too much time showering\
than I like to admit and I actually like\
some of my essay topics, but that doesn't mean\
I don't fantasise about murdering my professors any less

Plus, even if Wordsworth is right,\
there's still more mud covered asses I want to\
see in obscure train stations\
I have a dream that one day I'll pack up\
my definition of minimalist belongings\
and live in an attic in London like the\
dirt poor, cis male, entitled pricks that came before me\
because I'm not staring at trees for the next sixty years\
I've been trying to acknowledge that\
other people can be right sometimes\
but sometimes I still feel like bashing your skull\
open with my Encyclopedia of English Literature\
textbook\
I've been smiling at people more as I pass\
them in the hallway and the ones that smile back\
I think about for the rest of the day and the ones\
that don't I think about for the rest of the day\
with a twelve inch blade in my hand\
I've been going to these stuffy club meetings\
where I sit and read whatever over dramatic dog shit\
I wrote while slumped over on my desk, one hand\
on the tissue box and the other on the keyboard\
I've met some pretty cool people over the\
past two years\
some of them I see in the hallway and\
talk awkwardly for less than a minute\
before walking away and resisting the urge\
to blow my brains out at whatever\
nonsensical bullshit I just told them\
I've been thinking about cutting my hair\
recently because I spend more time ripping\
it out and it's the same hairstyle I've had since I\
was seventeen\
I've been thinking about how there's ignorant

people in this world and they're so much happier than me\
So, I'm getting better, dear friends,\
but don't stop praying for me.
