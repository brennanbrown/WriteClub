Birch peek with bark eyes, <br />
The hunter shoots, something falls. <br />
They saw nothing here.  <br />
Such silent centennials,  <br />
All death merges into one. <br />

Mushrooms fester slow,  <br />
Nursing and eating the oak <br />
Which creaks, cracks, and groans.  <br />

<div style="text-align: right"> 
Spring bears secrets fresh. <br />
Grass shoots through antlers and bone. <br />
Frozen meat for crows. <br />

I canâ€™t help but weep, <br />
A dog is buried under sand, <br />
Burned to ash and dust. <br />
The barn smolders, scorched meat reeks. <br />
Is it his or the cow's flesh? <br />
</div>
