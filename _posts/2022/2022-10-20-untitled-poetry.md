A thousand pictures away, <br />
Drive together up hot rust <br />
About we play luscious TV <br />
You trudging on garden bed <br />
Lust please rip him into meat. <br />

My feelings: A person who is destroying photos while reminiscing an unsatisfying relationship

Scream shipping <br />
Shadowed diamonds <br />
By wind lick all away <br />
Mist to me <br />
Ugly but see <br />
Never those with her and he <br />

She and a sibling escaping their ugly reality by ship as stowaways.
