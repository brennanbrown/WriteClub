walking at midnight in the city of lights <br />
the street lights flickering with the stars above <br />
a gentle breeze intertwines with my hair <br />
feeling leaves crunch their little deaths <br />
neath my feet on the cobble path

i feel a kind of free I’ve longed to be <br />
the beauty of the world revealing itself to me <br />
for after the fog has all lifted away <br />
i’m left with nothing but love at the end of the day

i let myself linger and I feel at home <br />
walking at midnight in the city of lights alone
