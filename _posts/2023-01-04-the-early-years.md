the early years are nothing but pictures  
snapshots of a different life lived

<div style="text-align: center">
by a different girl  
</div>

she was happy and smiling  
she was young and free  
from what society would inevitably  

<div style="text-align: center">
need her to be  
</div>

she was so innocent and young  
but that was then  

<div style="text-align: center">
now  
</div>

that little girl is gone  
nothing but pictures in a book  
words on a yellowing page.  

she grew up into me  
you are still in there little punkin  
but you are different.  
we changed. gone are the scraped knees and climbéd trees  
now its pained memories and empty pleas.  

the candles are much more heavy  
now begging to go back to that perfect life  
but little one you are safe with me  
i’ll hold the misery
