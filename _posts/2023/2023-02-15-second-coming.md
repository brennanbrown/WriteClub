I snapped a picture of you the other day when you weren't looking\
capturing the entirety of your face\
as you lay oblivious and a victim\
incarcerating the elegant flare of\
your cheekbones

which kind of remind me of the\
wings of wild geese as they\
perk up against the clouds\
hugging a sky that is way too similar\
to your eyes bestowing the image of\
swimming too far down and letting\
your lungs fill with dark blue resonance\
I wish to drown there

I could hear your heartbeat and I still said nothing.\
Your face is cropped like the image on my\
phone\
fair skin aligned with black borders\
I think you looked back once and the flash\
of laughter pooled over your features like the\
blood of babies scorching the streets of\
Ireland in red glory\
You know, you should smile more often\
not for my satisfaction but you're far\
too pretty to look so perpetually constipated\
A single, indirect smile\
nearly made me\
strike the board and cry\
Look me in the face once and I promise\
I'll leave you alone

I stared at you and I thought about\
how we pass through life with more\
words neatly tucked under our lips\
than released in the atmosphere\
I wonder if in another millenia\
when you and I are both dust, I'll say\
those words into the wind as somebody\
bestowing a different form\
I'll meet you in another imperceptible future\
where we won't remember this moment\
of unspoken shyness and polite classroom customs\
if I have the option to remember I will\
and I'll come looking for you.
