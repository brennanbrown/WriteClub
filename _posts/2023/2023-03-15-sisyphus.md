startled by the buzzing alarm  
but not enough to get up  
class in an hour  
sleeps two more

rolling over, looking at the time  
accepting the repeated defeat  
groaning and stretching  
everything out of place

hobble over to the dresser  
down the pre sorted pharmacy  
crawl to the bathroom to rid last nights dehydration  
warm frozen bones under running water

pour a bowl of stale cereal and stare  
too nauseous to eat  
too hungry to not  
distract with neuron numbing news

slide back into bed  
unmade, unchanged  
contemplate what to do with the day  
class is already over

laundry begging to be folded  
days old with grandma wrinkles  
hair asking to be brushed  
but the sparrows like their new home

the acid ache spreading through every vein  
get up to grab the pills  
candy coated and addictive  
a worthless endeavor

three in the afternoon only four hours awake  
drifting off to a neglected show  
waking up unrested and confused  
laptop and mind dead

trying to get up again  
but slippery sockets donâ€™t hold very tight  
with shaky breathe and anticipated pain  
joints find where they belong

finally time to wash off the weeks failure  
water burning red snakes into gray purple skin  
time loses meaning and body loses feeling  
stiff fingers cant wash oil slicked hair

only leaving the numbing steam  
when the ice cuts too deep  
shivering into an unwashed towel  
left dripping wet and hopeless

messy bed calling  
empty stomach rumbling  
pre packaged protein  
to end another unsuccessful day

body craving sleep  
mind needing distraction  
heavy head finally getting rest only to be  
startled by the buzzing alarm
