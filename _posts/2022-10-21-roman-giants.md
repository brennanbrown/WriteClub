Who would not salvage the dust for the poor, <br />
or whatever the change may be for the well-versed men in dollars? <br />
So be it, the Roman giants or Russian oligarchs whom search for vast heaps of green in corporate monasteries, <br />
chime in, fairing equity, for their Wallstreet yachts, oligarch suits, and whatever their norm might be. <br />

How little do they think of their neighbours? Or the next country over? <br />
Would they truly give their neighbours fair bidding, when in a bind? <br />
Men in white suits and leather shoes, calling one another Vikings for counting numbers. <br />
Humanitarianism by listening to one different from one's self, is forsaken, <br />

for gold watches and thick jeans with impeccable stitches. <br />
The poor robbed with their life, cycle through the habits of trudging in labour or vice, <br />
as bourgeoise keep clean as they watch the noose tie tight, <br />
when a man chokes and gags on the weight of disparity. <br />

But surely the men in suits would want to live freely and others should work harder to be as them. <br />
The bare feet of the man could hardly kick the dirt, or the wooden planks beneath him.
