I used to think that being alone  
was unbearable,  
but now that I’ve pushed almost  
every single person I’ve ever held dear  
away from me,  
I really don’t think it's that bad  

And if you think this is a cry for help  
then you’re a moron,  
because I may be alone  
but I’ve also never felt quite as free  
you know, like that one Johnny Hobo  
song where he talks about screaming his  
heart out to nobody while overdosing on heroin,  
except I’m not overdosing on heroin because  
I hate needles and I’m busy  
treating my computer screen better than I  
have any human on planet earth  

It gets lonely sometimes, but it isn’t so bad  
there’s a lot of things I can do alone that  
I simply can’t do when accompanied by other people  
You know,  
like opening Instagram for the sixth  
time in three minutes because my form  
of catharsis is watching other people go to  
scenic places and live eventful lives,  
or scrolling through Youtube trying  
to find a murder documentary you haven’t  
watched before to prove that you are indeed a  
terrible person,  
but not as sick as the inhumane glance of a creature  
that killed for absolutely no reason  
I keep telling myself that I actually  
get a lot of messages and I’m not receiving  
them because the Canadian government is  
just looking out for my ego  
I get excited when I hear the vibration  
of my cellular device reverberating  
off of a flat surface but the brief  
rush of dopamine leaves my body when  
I see its from a family member,  
like,  
when is it ever not a family member  

All of these games look the same  
to me  
the movement of my mouse  
has just become an addition to my  
monotonous routine of trying to  
spark something in my brain to induce  
excitement  
sometimes I think I want to  
play a game but then I’ll sit there  
for thirty minutes contemplating  
the destruction of my life in the hands  
of the main character  

You haven’t been around lately,  
so I’ve resorted to dragging my feet  
on the rug so intensely that the lined  
skin above my heel has smoothed  
out like those rocks the girls with coloured  
hair and daddy issues like to  
pray to as if they’re Christians  
drinking watered down wine  
thinking it is the blood of God  
I tell myself that if I can’t get into  
honors that it’ll be the day I finally  
get my driver’s license and go  
way up North into the Yukon and  
become some deadbeat fisherman  
that doesn’t wash his ass  
and beats off to the voices in his head  

I tell myself that once I’m done with  
college I’ll take some plane out of here  
because there’s nothing left in this city  
anymore but broken bonds and the people  
who I’ve indirectly hurt by pricking  
their skin with a pencil, accidentally  
mistaking them for a sheet of paper  

You know, I’m just waiting for something  
cool to happen so I can stop  
masturbating to retro roller rink competitions  
not in an attempt to pleasure myself,  
but to kill time- instead of myself  

Sorry, my bad, that one was kind  
of insensitive  
but, I think there are things that  
are more insensitive  
like, you know  
there’s a reason why Calgary locked  
up all of the train station shelters  
during the winter time in 2021  
there’s a reason why Boris plants  
borders on the train tracks over in  
London even though they share the same  
purpose as a bandaid on a broken leg  
or a sign saying “haha, please don’t kill  
yourself haha”  
There’s a reason why all of those hippies  
got beat until their faces were black and blue  
and their remnants were smeared across the pavement  
back in the counterculture movement of 1968  
There’s a reason why shootings are named  
instead of children  
There’s a reason why the goblins in  
Harry Potter look the way they do  
and Hitler is just sad he never got to  
pick up a copy  

Sometimes I feel like walking up to the  
presentation stand in the middle of a lecture  
and ripping the monitor out of the socket  
in the desk and throwing it across the room  
so it shatters in an industrial mess against the  
styrofoam coloured wall, but that would make  
me a massive hypocrite because I love my  
machine so I hope someday I stop finding  
videogames fun so I can stop lying to everyone  
including myself  

I say all of this but I’ve been trying  
my hardest to not loathe everything I see  
I walk up the stairs in the train shelter  
and I try not to let the sadness get  
to me as I pass the two Indigenous folk  
nestled together in a corner  
nodding out to the rhythm of their own hearts  
there was a traffic jam today on the bridge  
from Cranston to Stoney Trail and I tried  
not to throw up as I saw a cop cruiser parked  
behind an abandoned mini van conveniently  
placed next to the railing of the bridge  
I’ve been trying not to blame myself for  
everything even though it is my fault,  
and the people who I used to be able to  
look in the eye I can’t anymore but some  
middle aged lady on Youtube said the easiest  
way to get rid of guilt is to make a choice and  
I’m sorry but I choose me  
I like me, even when I’m not supposed to  
I’ve been trying all my life not to  
like me, and maybe that’s the problem  

I think I’m ready to stop spending so much time  
in my room and ranting about how much  
everything around me sucks  
I guess right now I’m just looking for  
something, someone, to wipe the boredom  
right off my face
