Holding sunburnt breath, across bow valley  
i thread & braid for the first time,  
yr only acres away, across bow trail  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ought i stand up from my desk? reach across chasm & confess?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white-knuckles spill no blood, i am paralyzed  
seeking refuge in the dharma, Triratna, 3 jewels lined-up across bow river.  

Urban farmlands terrify a young halfbreed boy, summer mosquito bites 
sticking to expired paper transit tickets, route #13, or the Red line—  
pray the gravity of the peace officer's nightstick isn't as harsh this time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before sending yr little brother off to an educated kindergarden.  

Living underneath the purebred;—waiting within the deep heart of the new west:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gently burn the rosemary & sage, ring the Tibetan bowl  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next to the quartz statue of John A. MacDonald;—  
the textile misanga i fastened with my lips, not worn by anybody, (i promise i'm good).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the army of automated Klansmen draws nearer each day i forget to watch over you.  

Taking public transit thru asphalt oceans, watching Rainbow-singing glass  
reflects lemon sunlight on the Mohkínstsis tower, sprouting like a tree,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swaying below a survival-coloured skyline.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cascades of Nose Hill crocuses encircle  
the only remaining Hallmark™ card abandoned in Chinook Centre  
written within are the sounds of the Siksika, the Piikuni, the Kainai, the Tsuut'ina  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bludgeoned from the vocal cords of each heart i’ve fallen in love w/.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yr friendship is the heaviest weight i've pulled,  
giving me twilight-shaded bruises. sharpest paper cuts. poisoned insect bites.
