As I slowly become the thing I hate. I can sense the turning tables that now escalate. I will begin to choke, upon these sighs and the sight of the horrid yellow smoke. For it is centuries old and missing its mark.

I obsess over that remark.

And I know, I know, that it pays fortune and then turns. Turning its head my way. And I see the blisters, and wounds, upon my mirror so faintly, Appearing, like a candle, taunting the dark, miles away, from my imperfect eyes.

A burn that I hate. A smell vial. Beautiful. The flowers turn, to see whose yelling. Flooding and cascading. Like I use to be. Holding on, to the slowly moving harmonies; That go lengths of time, without starvation or pride.

We are the solders, serving against time. Time and time and time and time and time and time. Listen to the blisters that pretend to rhyme. Away with the courtesans and partisan planes. We are the ones who came here first. And we are but the same, as the original ballets, and sonnets, too.

I come here asking, for the Comet's clues. To lead me back home, towards my tomb. Never ending. And caressed with lies. I hold my breath. Until the fondness says goodbye, and I dare not look, into her eyes. Or else the world's falling, will lead me to ember-shaded skies.

I wander and think to myself, as the harsh bitter cold takes me. As it confesses to me. All that I can confess. Moving slowly toward the Ember stars, thrusting and moving. Moving toward the images I wish to be... I wander close and far.

You, however. My dear, sweet and sick sister of mine; With love unbounded by this race or blood, can wander no more. After the soundings of drops of rain. And after the quiet sounds when I scream your name. You wander no closer to me. So, I wander, closer to you.

Past the broken bearings, past the lies and torment. Into a faint blue distance that calls my name and smells of your sugary scent. This is the past I hold on too; The only thing to me that has meant.

The quiet cracklings of love and pain, ringing throughout my ears again. You are near, so nearby. But I am far, bleak inside my mournful self. I try to find you out there, outside my touch. Where we may meet again. Inside this cold, heartful clutch.

But my feelings are in vain, you are nowhere to be seen. I come across something close, but it disappears again. Sweet sister, tell me where you lay... Doth a corpse wither without decay? My feet breaking the Earth with every step above the leaves. Tell me where you hide yourself before my woeful dreams.

Lacking in what I thought I knew; she came from tail end. It was not the girl I was looking for. As her pure white cloth gently flew.

"Young Boy, your presence here disturbs us all. Why must you look for a spark that has ceased to be? Why must you live with yourself in broken imagery that slowly falls?"

But before I could spurt out my lips. The thunders of the clouds above washed away the thoughts that shoved and shattered away any and all ill-intent. As Nature slowly found her grip.

"I am not a madman," I said to this shade "But merely heart-bent. On finding what was taken from me, so long ago unfairly without repent. A love I thought was so strong, a bond found so rarely."

She lashed her eyes, blinded by her beau ideal. I went down in a gentle sob. She asked, "Why then must you hoard and steal?" Beginning her strain again. "From all those who have too been unduly done to them?" As though my earnest quest was one of greed and lust.

"Spectre, hear me. I come here out of hearts robust. I stand before you with hopes of gentle sway to get a final vow, to one I loved so long ago. Please do not leave me here with my only wish disallowed"

She then spoke nothing, from perfect lips. But made me instead contemplate all I had left. All that I had remarked. It then came upon me, like the falling stars above. She, the dear thing, seen. Inside my eyes the trail of deceit I had left in sparks.

My eyes widened, as I sighed. I understood now this wraith was forcing me to release. To abide by her, she was the force of the universe, a vision. I could now see, as well. Beholding all there was in my life that I could tell.

The perfection in my varnished mirror and the photographs lined up inside my catacomb were illusions of themselves and of what they used to hold. Of me and her and what I painted over. Of the things I lied to myself about, over and over. I understood as well as the white image before had sought.

"Spirit of this domain, please accept a boy's humble forgiveness." I bowed by head and closed eyes nearby. Her presence came toward me as I veered.

"Sweet, gentle child. Your mistakes are frequent with your brethren. You have lettered yourself. And all you had forgotten. Take yourself now, out of my sight. For the resting place you seek is one rattling blight!"

Her breath came upon my being like the warmth riding star. I knew she could heal the wounds and bountiful scars, the ones I placed upon myself, and the ones placed by my former Peeress. I knew with this presence I could climb the topples of experience with such thickness.

"Please" I implored to the Heavenly soul "If you leave me now, I will go on without anything in my heart at all" My breath becoming heavy, the sound of oceans crashing, the waters falling down my face. Entire planets, all of nature, stopped, and looked down for a moment. Pausing. Inverting.

She replied "My resting place is what is sought? For it rattles blight. Take yourself now, out of this whispery dead place, out into the newborn Midnight. You have lettered yourself, and all you had buried. Sweet, gentle child. Go now as this spirit is slowly emptied."

Tell me where you hide yourself, before my woeful dreams? I know my feelings are now in vain, for your spirit is but an empty gleam. I come across something close, but it disappears again.

Ringing throughout my ears again. The quiet cracklings of leaves and love and pain. I try to find you out there, outside my touch. Where we may meet again.

Inside this cold and heartless clutch.

The only thing to me that has meaning. This is now the past I hold on too; the smell of your sugary scent close to me, leaning.

But you are past the broken bearings, past the lies and torment. So, I will wander, closer to you. I wander close and far.

Moving toward the image I wish to be... Moving slowly toward the Ember stars, thrusting and moving. As it confesses to me, all that I can confess. I wander and think to myself, as the harsh bitter cold takes me.
