There are old journals on my bookshelf  
blank pages at the back  
filled with unfinished poetry  
similes with no synonyms  
metaphors with no meaning

prose left on pause  
But the girl who scribbled these words in ink is gone  
changed by experiences yet to be written  
Words lamenting past lovers that scorned her  
trying to heal fresh pain through pen and paper  
Now those feelings are a distant memory  
only existing as echoes in my identity  
And the ghosts of my past try to haunt me in these pages  
but their barbed wire smiles donâ€™t scare me like they used to  
The wounds have scarred over  
the girl has grown  
and this work will never be finished  
Forever a poem in progress  
as they all once were  
and all will be.
