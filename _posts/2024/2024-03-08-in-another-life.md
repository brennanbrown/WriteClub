You and I  
were once the two separate sides  
of the same electrical cord;  
often tangled between each other,  
building knots and kneading bundles of bridges  
on top cedar, oak and birch floorboards.  

One evening I broke my back  
bracing myself into high beams  
to build us a humble home,  
with sky-high ceilings,  
auxiliary offices on every sixth floor  
and underground parking lots  
for our hordes of indoor slippers  
and outdoor shoes.  

I remembered how my arms  
baled around your body in the bed,  
how your beige eyes blinked mindlessly,  
beaconing endlessly up and into my angles.  

I remembered you swaying softly  
while I held my breath and folded my limbs,  
meshing my tissue fibers together  
to transform into a hammock,  
holding onto the thought that you  

could never despise this haven, this asylum, this shelter  
I assembled for the two of us.  

But I shrugged it off,  
convincing myself those clusters of sparks  
slugging off your skull were signs you loved me back,  
but really they were just empty shells of a warm shotgun.  

I passed out,  
waking up to the fumbling dance  
of a fire no longer flickering  
but instead loitering leisurely  
on top where scars foamed up on our flesh  
and flakes of skin were filtered across fissuring gaps  
upon the charred up floorboards.  

I blamed myself,  
battering the bullet point  
straight into the streetlines of my brain  
that I was a buffoon for not hearing you beg for mercy.  
Nowadays in my sleep, I wonder often  
if you tried slithering out to escape.  

Or what would’ve happened if you slipped a sliver  
of a whisper into my ear to tell me:  
“Please stop suffocating me in my sleep.”  

Or what would’ve happened if you slammed your shoulder  
into my stomach and seethed your teeth  
into my skin while you screamed:  
“Let me out!”  

Or what would’ve happened if you slit my eyelids  
away from sitting shut to let me see the signs  
that I was doing too much in such a short amount of time.  

Or what would’ve happened if I stopped thinking  
and actually tried to save you;  
instead of reminiscing these tragedies  
and turning them into scattered tattoos  
to commemorate for the next lifetime.  

“Oh my god;  

I  
am  
so sorry”.
