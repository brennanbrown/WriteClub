Rapped In Love  
Drive, Gas,  
Broke, Drive,  
Brakes, Work,  
Walk, Sit,  

Study, Run,  
Sit, Test,  
Walk, Text,  
Call, Drive,  
Park, Walk,  
Your, eyes.

<div style="text-align: center;">
if things get Rocky<br>
Excuse Me<br>
to be Frank<br>
you make the Solo Nights easy<br>
take a Chance on me<br>
cause this is All We Got<br>
i would crawl out of Cole mines<br>
Four Your Eyez Only<br>
i will row the Drake passage<br>
to Find Your Love<br>
they could Outkast me<br>
and i would still scream Hey Ya!<br>
</div>
