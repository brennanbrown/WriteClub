**I'm reminded of Jace…**  
At the crosswalk by the hockey rink I first saw him play  
Barely able to stay standing on his own two feet  
Creating distance from his old self to his new  
Dominating on the ice today, making us proud  

**I'm reminded of Ava…**

Every time I look at the wall behind my desk  
Full of drawings and letters she wrote just for me  
Gifts that came from the heart  
Handmade with love, my precious treasures  

**I'm reminded of Georgia…**

In the music I listen to and hear all around  
Jamming together in the backseat of the truck growing up  
Karaoke on the TV, even in our adulthood  
Liking the same songs, keeping us connected unknowingly  

**I'm reminded of Mom…**

Mornings on the bus thinking about my upcoming day  
Nights working hard, so I can make her proud  
One thing isn't enough to name when talking about her  
Part of her is in everything I do and hope to be  

**I'm reminded of Dad…**

Quitting work for the day and heading home  
Ready to show him all the different photos and videos I took  
Scrolling endlessly through to pick the best ones for him  
The smile on his face when he sees my little collection is contagious  

**I'm reminded of my family…**

Under the covers after a hard day  
Various thoughts in my head, but one sticking out most  
Wherever I find myself I can also find them  
Examples of strength, love, expression, pride, and joy  
You are my everything, and my everything is you
