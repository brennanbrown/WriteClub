Mount Royal University's Creative Writing Club is a safer space for writers of all kinds and experience, both for a place to work and a place to (optionally) share, as well as offering prompts, activities, exercises, and sharing resources. Please read our [Code of Conduct](/terms)

**New!** For the Spring 2023 semester, meetings will be held in the **MRU Clubhouse (Z306) once a week on Thursdays from 4:30pm - 6:30pm**. The meetings will be open to all Mount Royal University students and will be free of charge, non-students are also welcome but cannot vote on club policy.

Each meeting will begin with a brief introduction and overview of the club and its activities, followed by a fun and creative prompt or exercise to get everyone's creative juices flowing. After that, participants will be encouraged to share any works they may have been working on in a Writer's Round Table. Members can bring in their work, have other members read it, and then provide constructive feedback in a supportive, non-judgemental environment. 

There will be Writing Prompt Nights, where each member can bring a prompt or excerpt from a piece they really enjoy, and then everyone has 10 minutes to write a piece based on the prompt. Then everyone can share what they wrote.

In regards to other activities, there will also be contests, where members can submit their work anonymously, and then the club can pick a winner who will receive a prize. We will also host “show & tell” nights – members can bring in artifacts, photos, artwork, or anything else that inspires them and talk about why it inspires them.

We will also discuss our online publication (https://writeclub.ca/) and if anybody has any work they would like to have published there via our Google Drive. Finally, the meeting will end with a discussion and Q&A, where members can ask questions about the club or about writing in general.

In the future, I plan for us to have guest speakers, open mic nights, movie nights, and writing retreats.
