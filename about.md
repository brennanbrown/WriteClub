## About Write Club

Write Club was founded in autumn of 2022 at Mount Royal University. Initiated by a student with a vision, but no prior leadership experience, B. Kenneth Brown. The club began modestly with less than a dozen founding members. This small group quickly expanded as enthusiasm and interest in reviving a creative writing community took hold.  

In its first year, Write Club carved out a space within the university library where members, regardless of their major, gathered to indulge in the joy of writing and sharing. Our meetings include freewriting exercises, games, and sharing sessions. A place where students share poetry, short stories, and essays in an environment free from judgment. The club's activities now extend beyond weekly meetings. What have we done since we began?

1. **Poetry and Prose Slam**: A competitive event where writers performed original poetry and short prose pieces in front of an audience and judges.
2. **Author Q&A with Genki Ferguson**: An interactive session where club members had the opportunity to ask questions and gain insights from established author Genki Ferguson.
3. **Just My Type Fundraising Event**: A Valentine's Day fundraiser where attendees could get typewritten personalized poems/messages to loved ones on vintage typewriters.
4. **Queer BIPOC Writing Workshop with Anuja Varghese**: An inclusive workshop focusing on science fiction/fantasy from the queer BIPOC community, led by writer Anuja Varghese.
5. **Open Mic Night**: An informal event where members and school faculty showcased their writing talents, ranging from poetry readings to musical performances.
6. **Poetry Slam**: A poetry contest that challenged participants to present their most compelling spoken word pieces.
7. **Micro Storytelling Event**: A gathering for club members to engage in the art of short, succinct storytelling.
8. **Collaborative Movie Night**: A joint event with the "Palestine Advocacy Club," the "Somali Students Association," and the "Middle Eastern, East/North Africa, and Asian Student Affiliation" to foster cultural awareness and solidarity through film.
9. **Anthology Book Launch**: A celebration of the club's published work, [**"On the Fringe: A Collection of Filth"**](https://www.amazon.ca/Fringe-Collection-Filth-Dana%C3%AB-Webb/dp/B0CYQ1NRY9), which featured readings from contributors and discussions about the pieces included in the anthology.
